Chosen plaintext attack.
The cryptanalyst possesses some plaintexts and corresponding ciphertexts. In addition, it has the ability to encrypt several pre-selected plaintexts (before the attack starts).
fivfv:
• an attack based on obtaining a temporary non-confidential
access to the encryption device to obtain open pairs
and secret texts (there are known cases of implementation of such attacks by special services);
• an attack based on the use of information about the structure of messages or standard phrases - cryptanalysts from Bletchley Park (Bletchley Park) could determine the plaintext of messages
"Enigma" (see further laboratory work No. 4), depending on
when these messages were sent and how they were signed;
• enumeration of keys in a dictionary (dictionary attack) - a cryptanalyst encrypts words and phrases, the presence of which is expected
in a cipher, using different keys; coincidence
encrypted words and phrases with parts of the ciphertext may indicate a key breach.
Adaptive Plaintext Choice Attack
chosen plain text attack). The cryptanalyst has the ability to choose new plaintexts, taking into account the fact that he knows some information from previous messages - he can get
pairs "open message - ciphertext", including after
the start of the attack.Varieties:
• provoking the enemy to use in messages
certain words or phrases; invented by the British: Royal
air force receiving temporary non-confidential
access to the encryption device to obtain open pairs
and secret texts (there are known cases of implementation of such attacks by special services);
